# GSoC 2023 - Neutralinojs

Google Summer of Code 2023 ideas and guidelines - Neutralinojs

## What is GSoC?

GSoC (Google Summer of Code) is an international program that motivates developers to contribute to open-source projects. Google awards stipends for contributors who
successfully complete the GSoC program. GSoc contributors typically work on open-source development tasks under the guidance of organization mentors. Read more details about GSoC from the [official website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## How to become a GSoC contributor?

### 1. Neutralinojs Builder: a community project to generate Neutralino app packages

Neutralinojs CLI generates platform-specific binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows with a platform-independent resource file. Right now, Neutralinojs application developers need to use various tools to generate application installers (i.e.,: AppImage, NSIS) for each operating system. However, we have no plans to add application installer generation support to the official CLI to keep the CLI implementation minimal and less platform-dependent. Therefore, the Neutralinojs community has initiated a project called "Neutralinojs Builder" to generate application installers. The Neutralinojs builder project is still a POC and experimental, so the idea is to finalize the project based on the suggested technical specification finalized by the framework developers.

Areas: Node.js, Neutralinojs, Application bundling on operating systems

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

Possible Mentors: Shalitha Suranga, Sainath Rao, TBD

#### Suggested technical decisions

- Creating a CLI plugin for the solution.
- Expose a new command to generate application packages.

```bash
# Installing the plugin
neu plugins --add neutralinojs-builder

# neu builder <target> <arch>
neu builder nsis --x64 # NSIS setup for Windows x64
neu builder deb --ia32 # Debian package for GNU/Linux ia32
neu builder appimage --x64 # AppImage for GNU/Linux x64
neu builder deb # GNU/Linux Debian packages for all supported CPU architectures

# Use configuration from neutralino.config.json
neu builder

# Removing the plugin
neu plugins --remove neutralinojs-builder
```
- If the developer run `neu builder` without any parameters, get the targets from the config file:

```json
"cli": {
  "builder": {
    "linux": {
      "targets": [
        {
          "target": "deb",
          "arch": [
            "x64",
            "ia32",
            "armhf"
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    "win": {
      "targets": [
        {
          "target": "nsis",
          "arch": [
            "x64",
            "ia32"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
- Even though Neutralinojs provides x64 binaries officially, implement multi-architecture support.
- Implement package targets as internal plugins (Import only required modules based on targets). Try to use modules like `targets/deb.js`, `targets/nsis.js` for dynamic loading.

### 2. Support Unicode characters in Neutralinojs Windows version

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/613

Unicode characters work without any issue on Neutralinojs Linux and macOS versions. But, 
Neutralinojs Windows version doesn't render Unicode characters correctly.
The goal of this task is to use Windows Unicode APIs and fully support Unicode in the Neutralinojs Windows version.

Areas: Windows API, Refactoring, and Text Encoding

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

Possible Mentors: Shalitha Suranga, Sainath Rao, TBD

#### Suggested technical decisions

- Create helper functions to convert C++ string to Windows wide char and vice versa (Check [this](https://github.com/samhocevar/portable-file-dialogs/blob/67e7b0945aac80efa2ec5c72de98b47f7552735c/portable-file-dialogs.h#L420) example).
- Replace all ASCII Win32 functions with Unicode versions.

### 3. Make Neutralinojs compatible with older Windows versions

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/486

Neutralinojs is tested on Windows 10 and 11, but it is not well-tested 
with previous Windows versions. The goal of this idea is to update Neutralinojs framework
source, build scripts, and DevOps workflow to officially support older Windows versions.

Areas: Windows API, DevOps, and Configuration

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

Possible Mentors: Sainath Rao, TBD

#### Suggested technical decisions

*None -- cause needs to be indentified first*

### 4. NodeNeutralino: a community project to explain Neutralinojs custom backends

The goal is to create a sample wrapper project to guide developers to use a Node.js backend for a Neutralinojs app with
the extension API. This project will use Neutralinojs via Node.js child process API and communicate with the Neutralinojs extension API.

Areas: Node.js and Neutralinojs

Difficulty rating: Easy

Project size: ~175h

Possible Mentors: Sainath Rao, TBD

#### Suggested technical decisions

- Implement an API similar to Electronjs [`BrowserWindow`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window) class.

Example NodeNeutralino app code:

```js
const { NeutralinoApp } = require('node-neutralino');

// Accepts all configuration options available in Neutralino.window.create
// Don't manipulate the config file -- use internal CLI arguments instead.
const app = new NeutralinoApp({
              url: '/resources', 
              modes: {
                window: {
                  width: 500,
                  height: 500
                }
              }
             });

// Every Neutralino.window API function is available except window.create and draggable regions API
app.window.setFullScreen();
app.window.hide();
app.window.show();

// All other Neutralino APIs are also available
app.storage.setData('testKey', 'testValue');
app.debug.log('Hello');
app.filesystem.createDirectory('TestDir');

// Neutralino.app functions are available directly via the app instance
app.broadcast('testEvent');
app.exit();
```
- Try to implement without any third-party Node module.
- Make every function asynchronous and throw Neutralinojs [error codes](https://neutralino.js.org/docs/api/error-codes) properly.
- Use Node.js [child process API](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_processspawncommand-args-options) to spawn Neutralinojs binaries.
- Create an app template for Neutralinojs CLI.
- Use a project structure similar to the Neutralinojs client library.

### 5. Fix `os.setTray` function problem for older macOS versions

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/615

The os.setTray function fails on macOS Catalina and some other versions.
The goal of this task to debug the Neutralinojs macOS binary on different macOS versions and 
apply a generic solution.

Areas: Cocoa API and Debugging

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

Possible Mentors: TBD

#### Suggested technical decisions

- Add additional configuration code to the [webview fork](https://github.com/neutralinojs/webview) rather than updating `window.cpp` if possible.

### 6. Adding window transparent setting to the configuration

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/roadmap/issues/1

Add the `transparent` (Boolean) option to the configuration to control the webview's opacity on all supported platforms. When the setting is set to `true`, and the 
CSS background also has `opacity` as `0`, the user should be able to see through the window clearly. Transparency can be disabled by setting the `transparent` property to `false`. The developer can adjust the window transparency level with CSS. 

Areas: GTK, Cocoa, Win32 APIs

Difficulty rating: Hard

Project size: ~350h

Possible Mentors: TBD

#### Suggested technical decisions

- Try to implement the solution within [`window.cpp`](https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/blob/main/api/window/window.cpp)
- Add implementation via a new function named `setTransparent()` under the `window` namespace. Invoke from `__createWindow`.
- Use `false` as the default value.
- Add as a CLI argument too (`--window-transparent`)

### 7. C++/JavaScript integration test system enhancements

Issue: https://github.com/neutralinojs/neutralinojs/issues/706

Neutralinojs project has a integration test suite for testing both C++ and JavaScript code at once. Currently, Neutralinojs integration tests covers minimal tests 
to detect possible function breakdowns. The goal of this task is to write a complete test suite covering all aspects of Neutralinojs APIs and global variables. Also, we expect to run the test suite on Windows CI instance too.

Areas: Neutralinojs, Unit/Integration testing, Node.js and GitHub Actions

Difficulty rating: Medium

Project size: ~350h

Possible Mentors: Shalitha Suranga, Sainath Rao, TBD

#### Suggested technical decisions

- Increase test coverage by adding more test cases.
- Test global variables properly.
